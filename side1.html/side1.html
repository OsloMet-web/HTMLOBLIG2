      Surveying the atmospheres of planets beyond the solar system, such as those in the TRAPPIST-1 system 
      (artist's concept of four of the system's seven planets shown), could turn up interesting molecules that 
      might indicate life. But ruling out false positives will be a challenge.</p>
  </div>
  <p> In June, astronomers reported a disappointing discovery: The James Webb Space Telescope failed to find a 
    thick atmosphere around the rocky planet TRAPPIST-1 C, an exoplanet in one of the most tantalizing 
    planetary systems in the search for alien life. 
  </p>

    <p>The finding follows similar news regarding neighboring planet TRAPPIST-1 B, another planet in the TRAPPIST-
      1 system. Its dim, red star hosts seven rocky worlds, a few of which are in the habitable zone—at a distance 
      from their star at which liquid water could exist on their surfaces and otherworldly life might thrive.
    </p>

    <p>What it would take to detect that life, if it exists, isn't a new question. But thanks to the JWST, it's finally 
      becoming a practical one. In the next few years, the telescope could glimpse the atmospheres of several 
      promising planets orbiting distant stars. Hidden away in the chemistry of those atmospheres may be the first 
      hints of life beyond our solar system. This presents a sticky problem: What qualifies as a true chemical 
      signature of life?
    </p>

    <p>“You're trying to take very little information about a planet and make a conclusion that is potentially quite 
      profound—changing our view of the whole universe,” says planetary scientist Joshua Krissansen-Totton of 
      the University of Washington.
    </p>

    <p>To detect such a biosignature, scientists must find clever ways to work with the limited information they can 
      glean by observing exoplanets.</p>

    <h2 class="h2.sub-heading"> Chemicals in context</h2>
    <p>Even the most powerful telescopes, including the JWST, almost never “see” exoplanets—by and large, 
      astronomers know these distant worlds only by the flickering of their stars.</p>
